Hello, 

The following code is what a problem that is answering to each one of these user stories:

# Write out code to execute all user stories. Execute the methods so you can test and make sure it works.

# Brewery vs Beer
# User cases:
# 1. User can create a brewery with a name and location
# 2. User can add beers to brewery with name, type, and beer score (1-10).
# 3. User can delete a beer from a brewery (by name of the beer)
# 4. User can delete a beer from a brewery (by score that is less than 5)
# 5. User can print out all the beer names
# 6. User can print out all the beer names with scores 5 or greater.
# 7. User can find out the average beer score of all the beers in this brewery (this is a big one but you need to know.)

# BONUS:
# Program knows not to add any duplicate beers -- beers with the same name

#BONUS x2:
# Once your code works make it run via terminal (ARGV)
